How my tastes have changed over the time since I started using mechnical keyboards. I use to find this sort of tactilty quite delightful. Now I'm not sure how I feel about it. It's ok, it's just nothing special anymore. This is a nopre a fake topre, it feels different from any other keyboard I own but I'm not sure it feels that great. It's not terrible by any means but it's just not the sort of thing I am looking for anymore. I don't know how to describe it. It's just kind of dull and uninteresting. It's just sort of mushy and just meh feeling. I should basically put this up on mechmarket and see who will take it. I don't know if I would work an entire day with it anymore.

I actually haven't used this board since I lubed it. So the lube should have had some time to migrate around the entire switch and should now be comfortably be distributed across the entire keyboard.
